### Icons for your (wayland)Window Manager (i2ywm)

##### Plans:
- Add shadows to the text
- Automatically detect if file names should be either white or black based on the wallpaper
- Basic operations menu
- Basic file operations and xfdesktop-like behavior
- Open & Open with... in the menu

Currently implemented:
- Support for .desktop files
- Double click to execute or to automatically `xdg-open` the selected file
- Integration with AppBundles (see [PELF](https://github.com/xplshn/pelf))
- Thumbnails support
- Icon themes support (I haven't tested, because I do not have any icon themes installed, nor a "default" one)
